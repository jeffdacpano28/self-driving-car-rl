- **Memory**: At least 4 GB of RAM
- **Graphics**: Dedicated graphics card (NVIDIA or AMD recommended)
- **Software**: Python 3.7 or later (installed automatically with the application)

## 🏁 Features

- **Interactive Track Builder**  
  Create and customize your own racing tracks.

- **DQN & PPO Agents**  
  Train your agents to compete using cutting-edge reinforcement learning techniques.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Evaluate the performance of your agents in real-time.

- **Side-by-Side Comparison**  
  Compare different models and strategies during training.

## 📚 How to Use the Application

1. **Build a Track**  
   Open the track builder. Use drag-and-drop tools to shape your course. Save your track for use later.

2. **Train an Agent**  
   Select either a DQN or PPO agent. Set parameters like training duration and obstacles. Click “Start Training” to begin.

3. **Evaluate Performance**  
   After training, test your agent on the track. Watch in real-time how it performs and make adjustments as needed.

4. **Save and Share**  
   Save your trained models and share them with friends. You can also export your custom tracks to share with the community.
